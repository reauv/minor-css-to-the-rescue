# CSS to the rescue - exercise 1

## Demo
[Demo available here](http://css-one.rovansteen.nl)

## Source code
The CSS is written with Stylus as preprocesser, therefore the compiled source code is not available in the repository but the latest can ve viewed [here](http://css-one.rovansteen.nl/css/main.css).

## Misc
This website uses the brand new CSS grid layout module, which right now only works in Firefox & Google Chrome with a flag.
To enable it in Google Chrome go to `chrome://flags` and enable `Enable experimental Web Platform features`.
